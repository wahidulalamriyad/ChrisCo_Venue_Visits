Numerous data visualisation techniques to showcase the customers’ visits to the ChrisCo company. Conducted research and developed a system under Dr Chris Walshaw by implementing numerous data visualisation techniques to showcase the customers’ visits to the ChrisCo company by categorising them into high, medium and low. ChrisCo gathers a great deal of information about individual customers who visit its venues via its loyalty card programme. This information has been averaged to provide information about the company’s 40 locations. The author used a line plot, bar chart, scatter plot, heatmap plot, Pearson coefficient scatter plot, seasonality graph, line plot interactive and heatmap interactive plot to visualise all the required data.
